Hello

This Spring Boot project was developed in ItelliJ IDE Using Maven and Azul 17 SDK.

Two ways to run this project:
1. In IntelliJ IDE by running SpringBootApplication class RefineryDemoApplication.
2. In IntelliJ (or CMD), run maven package to generate JAT file, and then run JAR file using this command line:
java -jar [ROOT_FOLDER]\RefineryDemo\target\RefineryDemo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

P.S. You need to replace [ROOT_FOLDER] with the path of where you cloned this project folder.

In order to interact with this application, please use port 8080, for example:
http://localhost:8080/tasks

P.S. I tested the application using Postman.
